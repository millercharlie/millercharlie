## Programmer

I am a firm believe in the power of technology to change lives. Computer Science is on the cusp of this, with so many programs and applications changing the world. I wish to change the world in my own way by solving modern problems using technology. A few highlights of my work include the following:

### Personal Website

I created a digital portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with React. All design assets were created by me. Each page of this portfolio is designed to represent a part of my personality and interests.

### Markdown Notes Editor (Ongoing Project)

I am creating a markdown notes editor using Electron. All Markdown syntax will be supported, along with image addition.

## Designer

What could technology do without design? Design is extremely critical in solving problems with technology. I envision a future where good design is so ubiquitous that it doesn't need to be highlighted, with only bad design standing out. A few of my design projects from my portfolio are below!

### PATCO Modernization (Ongoing Project)

The Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO) is an electric rail line that connects downtown Philadelphia and suburban New Jersey. The line was one of the most modern in the world when it opened in 1969. The line was built for speed, with top speeds of up to 65mph, and was one of the first to use a form of automatic train operation, meaning that minimal driver input was necesary to drive it. For such a modern, innovative line, its design language and website are outdated. I redesigned some PATCO assets, such as their transit map, website, and overall design language.

### Congress Website Redesign

The current [congress.gov](congress.gov) website is antiquated. I redesigned the website to appear more modern! Figma was used for this project.

### Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Map Redesign

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) is the largest provider of public transportation to the Greater Boston region. The "T" subway and bus rapid transit network has a world-class map already, but I redesigned it using my own public transit map design language. I wanted this to be a purely rapid transit map, so I omitted key bus routes and commuter rail lines from this version.
